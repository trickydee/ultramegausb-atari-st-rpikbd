OLED Debug Information - v7.1.0
================================================================================

The splash screens now show debug information to help diagnose the Xbox/PS4
reconnection issue WITHOUT needing a serial console.

================================================================================

XBOX CONTROLLER SPLASH SCREEN (3 seconds)
================================================================================

┌────────────────────┐
│      XBOX!         │  ← Large text
│                    │
│    Xbox One        │  ← Controller type
│                    │
│  A:1 I:0 C:1       │  ← Debug info
└────────────────────┘

Debug Line Breakdown:
  A:1  = Address (USB device address, typically 1-4)
  I:0  = Instance (interface number, usually 0)
  C:1  = Connected (1=connected, 0=not connected)

What to Look For:
✅ C:1 = Controller is connected and should work
❌ C:0 = Controller detected but not connected (PROBLEM!)

If you see C:0, this means:
- TinyUSB detected the Xbox controller
- But initialization failed or controller isn't ready
- This is likely why it doesn't work after PS4

================================================================================

PS4 CONTROLLER SPLASH SCREEN (2 seconds)
================================================================================

┌────────────────────┐
│       PS4          │  ← Large text
│                    │
│   DualShock 4      │  ← Controller type
│                    │
│     Addr:1         │  ← Debug info
└────────────────────┘

Debug Line Breakdown:
  Addr:1 = USB device address

What to Look For:
- Address should be 1, 2, 3, or 4
- Helps track if USB addresses are being reused

================================================================================

TEST SEQUENCE TO FOLLOW
================================================================================

Test 1: Xbox First (Should Work)
─────────────────────────────────
1. Flash new firmware
2. Plug in Xbox controller
3. Watch OLED: Should show "XBOX!" with "A:X I:X C:1"
4. Test controls - should work ✅
5. Unplug Xbox

Test 2: Xbox After Xbox (Should Work)
──────────────────────────────────────
6. Plug in Xbox again
7. Watch OLED: Should show "XBOX!" with "A:X I:X C:1"
8. Test controls - should work ✅
9. Unplug Xbox

Test 3: PS4 (Should Work)
─────────────────────────
10. Plug in PS4 controller
11. Watch OLED: Should show "PS4" with "Addr:X"
12. Test controls - should work ✅
13. Unplug PS4

Test 4: Xbox After PS4 (THE PROBLEM TEST)
──────────────────────────────────────────
14. Plug in Xbox controller
15. Watch OLED CAREFULLY:

    CASE A: Shows "XBOX!" with "A:X I:X C:1"
            → Xbox IS connected
            → If controls don't work, it's a data flow issue
            
    CASE B: Shows "XBOX!" with "A:X I:X C:0"
            → Xbox detected but NOT connected ← LIKELY PROBLEM
            → Initialization failed after PS4 usage
            → This is what we need to fix
            
    CASE C: NO splash screen appears at all
            → TinyUSB driver isn't detecting Xbox
            → Major USB stack issue after PS4

16. Test controls and note whether they work

================================================================================

WHAT THE C:0 vs C:1 MEANS
================================================================================

C:1 (Connected)
───────────────
✅ TinyUSB successfully enumerated the device
✅ XInput driver initialized the controller
✅ Endpoints opened successfully
✅ Controller ready to send data
✅ Should work normally

C:0 (Not Connected)
───────────────────
❌ TinyUSB detected the device
❌ BUT: XInput initialization incomplete
❌ Controller not ready to send data
❌ Will NOT work

Common Causes of C:0:
- Xbox 360 Wireless waiting for sync
- Endpoint communication failed
- Init packet not acknowledged
- USB state confused after previous device

================================================================================

KEY DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS
================================================================================

After running Test 4 (Xbox after PS4), answer these:

Q1: Did the splash screen appear?
    YES → TinyUSB detected the Xbox controller
    NO  → TinyUSB driver not recognizing device

Q2: What was the C: value?
    C:1 → Controller connected (good!)
    C:0 → Controller detected but not connected (THIS IS THE BUG!)

Q3: Did the controls work?
    YES + C:1 → Everything is working! 🎉
    NO + C:1  → Data flow issue (controller connected but data not flowing)
    NO + C:0  → Expected (controller not connected)
    NO + No splash → Major issue (Xbox not detected at all)

Q4: What address was shown?
    Same as before → Good, consistent
    Different → USB address changed (expected, but note it)

================================================================================

MOST LIKELY SCENARIO
================================================================================

Based on your description, when you do Test 4 (Xbox after PS4), you'll
probably see:

┌────────────────────┐
│      XBOX!         │
│                    │
│    Xbox One        │
│                    │
│  A:X I:X C:0       │  ← Notice C:0 here!
└────────────────────┘

This means:
- Xbox WAS detected by TinyUSB ✅
- But initialization failed ❌
- Controller not marked as "connected" ❌

This tells us the fix needs to be in the XInput initialization sequence,
possibly related to how the controller state is managed after other USB
devices have been used.

================================================================================

NEXT STEPS AFTER TESTING
================================================================================

Please report back:
1. What you saw on the OLED for each test
2. Specifically the C: value in Test 4
3. Whether controls worked or not

This will tell us exactly where the problem is and how to fix it!
