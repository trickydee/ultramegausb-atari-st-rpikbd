# PS3 DualShock 3 Controller Implementation

**Date Started:** October 29, 2025  
**Branch:** ps3-ds3-controller  
**Base Version:** 9.0.0  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Code Complete - Ready for Hardware Testing

---

## üéØ Goal

Add full support for Sony PlayStation 3 DualShock 3 controllers to the Atari ST USB Adapter.

**Phase 1 Complete:** All code has been written and successfully compiles. Ready for hardware testing!

## üìã PS3 DualShock 3 Specifications

### USB Identification:
- **Vendor ID:** 0x054C (Sony)
- **Product IDs:**
  - 0x0268 - DualShock 3 (standard)
  - Others TBD

### Known Features:
- D-Pad (8-direction)
- 2 Analog sticks
- 4 Face buttons (‚ñ≥, ‚óã, ‚úï, ‚ñ°)
- 4 Shoulder buttons (L1, L2, R1, R2)
- Analog pressure-sensitive buttons
- Motion sensors (6-axis)
- PS button

## üîç Research Needed

### Questions to Answer:
1. What VID/PID does your specific PS3 controller report?
2. Does it require special USB initialization?
3. What is the HID report format?
4. Are buttons pressure-sensitive in USB mode?

### Reference Projects to Check:
- Linux kernel PS3 driver
- libusb PS3 implementations
- RetroArch PS3 support
- Other open-source PS3 USB parsers

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Detection ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- [x] Add ps3_controller.h with definitions
- [x] Add ps3_controller.c with basic structure
- [x] Implement detection function
- [x] Build successfully compiles
- [ ] Get VID/PID from actual hardware (NEXT STEP)
- [ ] Test detection with OLED display

### Phase 2: Report Parsing (In Progress)
- [x] Enable debug to see raw report bytes
- [x] Basic report parser structure created
- [ ] Identify actual report structure from hardware
- [ ] Map buttons to bytes
- [ ] Map D-Pad format
- [ ] Map analog sticks

### Phase 3: Integration ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- [x] Add to hid_app_host.c detection
- [x] Add to hid_app_host.c report processing
- [x] Add to hid_app_host.c unmount callback
- [x] Add to HidInput.cpp joystick handler
- [x] Add get_ps3_joystick() function
- [x] Add to CMakeLists.txt
- [x] Add declaration to HidInput.h
- [x] Implement ps3_to_atari() mapping (skeleton)

### Phase 4: Testing (Waiting for Hardware)
- [ ] Test D-Pad directions
- [ ] Test analog stick movement
- [ ] Test fire buttons
- [ ] Test hot-swap
- [ ] Verify other controllers still work

### Phase 5: Polish (Pending)
- [x] Create splash screen (basic version)
- [ ] Refine splash screen after testing
- [ ] Disable debug displays for production
- [ ] Update README.md
- [ ] Create release notes
- [ ] Bump version to 9.1.0 or 10.0.0

## üìù Notes

### PS3 vs PS4 Differences:
- PS3 may require special USB initialization
- PS3 uses different report format than PS4
- PS3 has pressure-sensitive buttons (may/may not work over USB)
- PS3 was designed for PlayStation USB protocol (may need pairing)

### Similar Controllers:
Based on Stadia/PS4 experience:
- Will likely need manual byte parsing
- Should follow similar pattern to existing controllers
- D-Pad likely hat switch or bitmask
- Face buttons likely in one byte

## üéÆ Next Steps

**When Ready to Start:**
1. Plug in PS3 DualShock 3 controller
2. Enable debug mode: `DEBUG=1 ./build-all.sh`
3. Check OLED for VID/PID
4. Report values here
5. Begin implementation

## ‚úÖ Code Integration Complete!

**Files Created:**
- `include/ps3_controller.h` - PS3 controller definitions and API
- `src/ps3_controller.c` - PS3 controller implementation with debug support

**Files Modified:**
- `src/hid_app_host.c` - Added PS3 detection, mounting, report processing, unmounting
- `src/HidInput.cpp` - Added `get_ps3_joystick()` function and priority handling
- `include/HidInput.h` - Added `get_ps3_joystick()` declaration
- `CMakeLists.txt` - Added `ps3_controller.c` to build
- `build-all.sh` - Updated version to 9.1.0-dev, enabled debug by default

**Build Status:** ‚úÖ Successfully compiles for both RP2040 and RP2350

**Next Steps:**
1. Plug in PS3 DualShock 3 controller
2. Flash firmware: `dist/atari_ikbd_pico.uf2` or `dist/atari_ikbd_pico2.uf2`
3. Check OLED for VID/PID display
4. Report findings (VID, PID, raw report bytes)
5. Refine report parser based on actual data
6. Test and iterate

**Current Status:** Ready for hardware testing with full debug support enabled!
