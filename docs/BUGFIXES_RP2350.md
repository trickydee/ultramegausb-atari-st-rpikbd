# Bug Fixes and RP2350 Support

## Branch: bugfixes-rp2350-other-controllers

This branch contains important bug fixes for Xbox controller support and adds RP2350 (Raspberry Pi Pico 2) compatibility.

---

## Changes Summary

### 1. RP2350 (Pico 2) Support ✅

Added full support for building the firmware for both Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040) and Raspberry Pi Pico 2 (RP2350).

#### Building for Different Boards

**For Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040) - Default:**
```bash
cmake -B build -S . -DPICO_BOARD=pico
cd build && make
```

**For Raspberry Pi Pico 2 (RP2350):**
```bash
cmake -B build -S . -DPICO_BOARD=pico2
cd build && make
```

#### Output Files

The build system automatically names output files based on the target board:
- **Pico (RP2040)**: `atari_ikbd_pico.uf2`
- **Pico 2 (RP2350)**: `atari_ikbd_pico2.uf2`

This makes it easy to identify which firmware is built for which board.

### 2. Xbox Controller Joystick Counter Fix ✅

**Problem:** Xbox controllers were not incrementing the joystick counter on the OLED display.

**Root Cause:** Xbox controllers are handled by the official `xinput_host` driver which calls `tuh_xinput_mount_cb()` instead of `tuh_hid_mount_cb()`. The joystick counter (`joy_count`) was only incremented in the HID mount callback, so Xbox controllers were never counted.

**Solution:**
- Added new global counter `xinput_joy_count` to track Xbox controllers separately
- Modified `tuh_xinput_mount_cb()` to increment this counter when Xbox controllers are mounted
- Modified `tuh_xinput_umount_cb()` to decrement this counter when Xbox controllers are unmounted
- Added helper functions `xinput_notify_ui_mount()` and `xinput_notify_ui_unmount()` in HidInput.cpp
- Updated all UI notifications to show total joystick count: `joy_count + xinput_joy_count`

**Files Modified:**
- `src/main.cpp` - Added counter increment/decrement in xinput callbacks
- `src/HidInput.cpp` - Added xinput_joy_count global and UI notification functions
- `src/hid_app_host.c` - Call xinput_notify_ui_unmount() on HID unmount

**Testing:**
1. Plug in Xbox controller → OLED should show "Joy:1"
2. Plug in second Xbox controller → OLED should show "Joy:2"
3. Unplug one → OLED should show "Joy:1"
4. Plug in HID joystick while Xbox is connected → OLED should show "Joy:2"

### 3. Xbox Controller Splash Screen Reinstated ✅

**Problem:** The "XBOX!" splash screen was disabled (commented out with `#if 0`) when an Xbox controller was plugged in.

**Solution:** Re-enabled the splash screen in `tuh_xinput_mount_cb()` that displays:
- Large "XBOX!" text
- Controller type (Xbox One, Xbox 360 Wired, Xbox 360 Wireless, Xbox OG)
- Device address and instance number
- Displays for 2 seconds

**Files Modified:**
- `src/main.cpp` - Changed `#if 0` to active code

**Testing:**
1. Plug in Xbox controller
2. OLED should show "XBOX!" splash screen with controller type
3. Screen should display for 2 seconds then return to normal UI

---

### 4. Xbox Controller Reconnection Fix ✅

**Problem:** Xbox controller works on first connection, but after disconnecting it and connecting a PS4 controller (or any other device), then reconnecting the Xbox controller, it would not work properly.

**Root Cause:** The `xbox_controllers[]` array in `xinput_atari.cpp` stores pointers to controller interface structures. When a controller disconnects and reconnects:
- It may be assigned a different USB device address
- Old pointers in the array could become stale
- The reconnected controller's pointer might not be properly registered

**Solution:**
- Added defensive checks in `xinput_register_controller()` to detect and log when replacing an existing entry
- Added logging in both register and unregister functions to track controller lifecycle
- Added comments explaining the fix

**Files Modified:**
- `src/xinput_atari.cpp` - Enhanced registration/unregistration with logging and stale entry handling

**Testing Procedure:**
1. Connect Xbox controller → Should work, shows "Joy:1"
2. Disconnect Xbox controller → Should show "Joy:0"
3. Connect PS4 controller → Should work, shows "Joy:1"
4. Disconnect PS4 controller → Should show "Joy:0"
5. **Reconnect Xbox controller** → Should work again, shows "Joy:1" ✅ THIS IS THE FIX
6. Test buttons and analog sticks → Should respond correctly

## Technical Details

### Xbox Controller Tracking Architecture

**Before:**
```
HID Joysticks:  joy_count (tracked)
Xbox Controllers: (NOT tracked in UI)

Total displayed: joy_count only
```

**After:**
```
HID Joysticks:    joy_count (tracked)
Xbox Controllers: xinput_joy_count (tracked)

Total displayed: joy_count + xinput_joy_count
```

### Controller Registration Flow

```
USB Device Connected
    ↓
TinyUSB determines device class
    ↓
┌─────────────────┬─────────────────────┐
│  HID Device     │  XInput Device      │
│                 │  (Xbox Controller)  │
├─────────────────┼─────────────────────┤
│ tuh_hid_mount   │ tuh_xinput_mount    │
│      ↓          │      ↓              │
│ joy_count++     │ xinput_joy_count++  │
│      ↓          │      ↓              │
│ Update UI       │ xinput_notify_ui    │
│                 │      ↓              │
│                 │ Show XBOX! splash   │
└─────────────────┴─────────────────────┘
```

### RP2350 Platform Detection

The build system automatically detects which platform is being targeted:

```cmake
if(PICO_PLATFORM STREQUAL "rp2040")
    message(STATUS "Target: Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040)")
elseif(PICO_PLATFORM STREQUAL "rp2350-arm-s" OR PICO_PLATFORM STREQUAL "rp2350-riscv")
    message(STATUS "Target: Raspberry Pi Pico 2 (RP2350)")
endif()
```

The RP2350 can run in two modes:
- **ARM mode** (`rp2350-arm-s`): Compatible with existing Pico software
- **RISC-V mode** (`rp2350-riscv`): Experimental, uses RISC-V cores

By default, `pico2` board targets ARM mode for maximum compatibility.

```bash
# Pico with French interface
cmake -B build -S . -DPICO_BOARD=pico -DLANGUAGE=FR

# Pico 2 with German interface
cmake -B build -S . -DPICO_BOARD=pico2 -DLANGUAGE=DE
```

## Known Limitations

### RP2350 Compatibility

The RP2350 is pin-compatible with RP2040, but there are some differences:

1. **USB Host**: The RP2350 has improved USB hardware, but TinyUSB should handle this transparently
2. **Clock Speed**: RP2350 can run faster than RP2040 (up to 150MHz vs 133MHz stock)
3. **Power**: RP2350 may have slightly different power characteristics

**Recommendation:** Test thoroughly on RP2350 hardware before deploying.

### Controller Support

- Xbox controllers work via official TinyUSB XInput driver
- PS4 controllers work via custom driver
- Some generic HID controllers may not work properly
- Wireless Xbox 360 controllers require wireless receiver

---

## Debug Output

When running with serial console connected, you should see:

```
XINPUT MOUNTED: dev_addr=1, instance=0
  Type: Xbox One
XINPUT: Registered controller at address 1

[On disconnect:]
XINPUT UNMOUNTED: dev_addr=1, instance=0
XINPUT: Unregistering controller at address 1

[On reconnect:]
XINPUT MOUNTED: dev_addr=1, instance=0
  Type: Xbox One
XINPUT: Registered controller at address 1
```

If you see "Replacing existing controller" messages, it means the fix is working correctly.

## Troubleshooting

### Xbox Controller Not Counting

**Symptoms:** Xbox controller works but OLED shows "Joy:0"

**Solution:** This is the bug we fixed! Make sure you're running firmware from this branch.

### Xbox Controller Not Working After Reconnection

**Symptoms:** Works first time, but after using PS4 controller, Xbox doesn't work again

**Solution:** This is the second bug we fixed! The reconnection logic now properly handles controller swapping.

### Splash Screen Not Showing

**Symptoms:** Xbox controller works but no "XBOX!" splash screen

**Solution:** We re-enabled this. Make sure you're running the latest code.

### Build Fails for Pico 2

**Possible causes:**
1. Pico SDK version too old (need SDK 2.0.0+ for RP2350 support)
2. CMake cache from previous build

**Solution:**
```bash
rm -rf build
git submodule update --init --recursive
cmake -B build -S . -DPICO_BOARD=pico2
cd build && make
```
