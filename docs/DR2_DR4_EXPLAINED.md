# DR2 and DR4 Registers Explained

Understanding how the Atari ST reads joystick and mouse input through the HD6301 (IKBD) microcontroller.

---

## **What are DR2 and DR4?**

DR2 and DR4 are **Data Registers** in the HD6301 microcontroller (the IKBD chip). They're memory-mapped I/O ports that the 6301 firmware reads to get input from the physical hardware, and the Atari ST's main CPU reads them (via serial commands) to get keyboard/mouse/joystick data.

## **DR2 (Data Register 2) - Fire Buttons & Mouse Buttons**

**Address:** `$03` (DDR2 at `$01` controls direction)

### **Bit Layout:**
```
Bit 7 | Bit 6 | Bit 5 | Bit 4 | Bit 3 | Bit 2 | Bit 1 | Bit 0
  ?   |   ?   |   1   |  RxD  |  TxD  | JOY1  | JOY0  | Select
                                        Fire    Fire    74LS244
```

**Bit Assignments:**
- **Bit 0:** Output to select the 74LS244 chip (for reading DR4)
- **Bit 1:** Right mouse button OR Joystick 0 fire button
- **Bit 2:** Left mouse button OR Joystick 1 fire button  
- **Bit 3:** ACIA TxDATA (serial transmit from 6301)
- **Bit 4:** ACIA RxDATA (serial receive to 6301)
- **Bits 5-7:** Fixed at 1 in monochip mode

### **How Fire Buttons Work:**
- **Active LOW** - When a button is pressed, the bit is **CLEARED (0)**
- **Not pressed** - Bit is **SET (1)**

**Example:**
```c
// No buttons pressed:
DR2 = 0xFF (11111111)

// JOY0 fire pressed:
DR2 = 0xFD (11111101) - bit 1 cleared

// JOY1 fire pressed:
DR2 = 0xFB (11111011) - bit 2 cleared

// Both pressed:
DR2 = 0xF9 (11111001) - bits 1 and 2 cleared
```

### **The Encoding Bug We Fixed:**
The original code had:
```c
value = (st_mouse_buttons() * 2) % 6;
```

This tried to encode button states as:
- `mouse_state=1` (JOY1) → `(1*2)%6 = 2` → `0b00000010`
- `mouse_state=2` (JOY0) → `(2*2)%6 = 4` → `0b00000100`
- `mouse_state=3` (both) → `(3*2)%6 = 0` → `0b00000000` ❌ **BUG!**

**The Fix:**
```c
value = st_mouse_buttons() * 2;  // No modulo!
```

Now both buttons pressed correctly returns 6 instead of 0.

## **DR4 (Data Register 4) - Joystick Directions & Mouse Movement**

**Address:** `$07` (DDR4 at `$05` controls direction)

### **Bit Layout (Joystick Mode):**
```
Bit 7 | Bit 6 | Bit 5 | Bit 4 | Bit 3 | Bit 2 | Bit 1 | Bit 0
JOY1  | JOY1  | JOY1  | JOY1  | JOY0  | JOY0  | JOY0  | JOY0
Right | Left  | Down  |  Up   | Right | Left  | Down  |  Up
```

### **Bit Layout (Mouse Mode):**
```
Bit 7 | Bit 6 | Bit 5 | Bit 4 | Bit 3 | Bit 2 | Bit 1 | Bit 0
JOY1  | JOY1  | JOY1  | JOY1  | MouseY| MouseY| MouseX| MouseX
Right | Left  | Down  |  Up   |  bit1 | bit0  | bit1  | bit0
```

**Note:** When mouse is enabled on Port 0, the lower 4 bits show mouse movement, and the upper 4 bits still show Joystick 1 directions.

### **How Joystick Directions Work:**
- **Active LOW** - When a direction is pressed, the bit is **CLEARED (0)**
- **Not pressed** - Bit is **SET (1)**

**Example:**
```c
// No movement:
DR4 = 0xFF (11111111)

// JOY0 UP pressed:
DR4 = 0xEF (11101111) - bit 4 cleared

// JOY0 UP+RIGHT pressed:
DR4 = 0xE7 (11100111) - bits 3 and 4 cleared

// JOY1 DOWN pressed:
DR4 = 0xDF (11011111) - bit 5 cleared

// Both joysticks UP:
DR4 = 0xEF (11101111) - bits 4 and 0 cleared
```

### **Bit Masks for Directions:**
```c
// Joystick 0 (lower nibble)
#define JOY0_UP    0x01  // NOT: 0xFE
#define JOY0_DOWN  0x02  // NOT: 0xFD
#define JOY0_LEFT  0x04  // NOT: 0xFB
#define JOY0_RIGHT 0x08  // NOT: 0xF7

// Joystick 1 (upper nibble)
#define JOY1_UP    0x10  // NOT: 0xEF
#define JOY1_DOWN  0x20  // NOT: 0xDF
#define JOY1_LEFT  0x40  // NOT: 0xBF
#define JOY1_RIGHT 0x80  // NOT: 0x7F
```

### **Mouse Quadrature Encoding:**
The mouse uses the lower 4 bits as a **quadrature encoder**:
- **Bits 0-1:** Horizontal movement (X axis)
- **Bits 2-3:** Vertical movement (Y axis)

The pattern `0b0011` (3) rotates as the mouse moves:

**Horizontal (X axis):**
- **Left:** `0011 → 0110 → 1100 → 1001 → 0011` (rotate left)
- **Right:** `0011 → 1001 → 1100 → 0110 → 0011` (rotate right)

**Vertical (Y axis):**
- **Up:** Same rotation on bits 2-3
- **Down:** Opposite rotation on bits 2-3

**Example mouse movement:**
```c
// Mouse stationary:
DR4 = 0b11110011 (0xF3) - pattern 0011 in lower 4 bits

// Mouse moving right (one click):
DR4 = 0b11111001 (0xF9) - pattern 1001

// Mouse moving right (two clicks):
DR4 = 0b11111100 (0xFC) - pattern 1100
```

The Atari ST detects movement by comparing consecutive reads and seeing the pattern change.

## **How the 6301 Reads These Registers**

### **The Reading Process:**

1. **Game wants joystick data**
2. **Atari ST sends command to 6301** (via serial ACIA)
3. **6301 firmware executes code that reads DR2 and DR4**
4. **Our emulator's `dr2_getb()` and `dr4_getb()` functions are called**
5. **We return the current joystick/mouse state**
6. **6301 processes and sends data back to Atari ST**

### **When Are These Registers Read?**

The 6301 firmware reads these registers:
- **On demand** when the Atari ST requests joystick status
- **During VBL** (Vertical Blank) for automatic updates
- **When processing IKBD commands** (interrogate joystick, etc.)

The exact timing depends on:
- What IKBD mode is active (event reporting, interrogation, monitoring)
- How frequently the game polls for input
- The 6301 firmware's internal state machine

---

## **The Timing Issue: Fixed Schedule vs On-Demand**

### **STEEM's Approach (On-Demand):**
```c
// In dr2_getb() - called when 6301 reads DR2
if(NumJoysticks)
  JoyGetPoses();  // Update joystick state RIGHT NOW

// In dr4_getb() - called when 6301 reads DR4  
if(NumJoysticks)
  JoyGetPoses();  // Update joystick state RIGHT NOW
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Updates **exactly** when the game needs data
- ✅ No stale data - always fresh
- ✅ Better timing accuracy for rapid polling

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ More CPU overhead (polling on every read)
- ❌ Could be called very frequently (performance impact)

### **Our Current Approach (Fixed Schedule):**
```c
// In main loop - called every 10ms
HidInput::instance().handle_joystick();
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Predictable CPU usage
- ✅ Simpler to understand and debug
- ✅ Works fine for most games

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Can have stale data (up to 10ms old)
- ❌ Games polling faster than 10ms might miss updates
- ❌ Games with specific timing expectations might fail

### **The Problem Illustrated:**

```
Time:     0ms    10ms   16.6ms  20ms   33.2ms  40ms
          |      |      |       |      |       |
We update:●------●------+-------●------+-------●
          |      |      |       |      |       |
Game polls:      ●------●-------+------●-------+
          |      |      |       |      |       |
          A      A      B       B      C       C

At 16.6ms: Game gets state B (updated at 10ms)
At 33.2ms: Game gets state C (updated at 20ms, but read at 33.2ms)
           ↑ If button was pressed at 21ms and released at 32ms,
             game might never see it!
```

### **Why This Matters for Game Compatibility:**

Some games are **timing-sensitive**:

1. **Fast-paced games** (shooters, arcade ports) poll very frequently
   - Example: Space Harrier, Xenon, R-Type

2. **Games with specific timing** might poll during VBL or at exact moments
   - Example: Games syncing input to screen refresh

3. **Games testing for button release** need immediate updates
   - Example: Games with "tap vs hold" mechanics

4. **Games that poll multiple times per frame**
   - Example: Games checking for combo inputs

If the game reads DR2/DR4 and we haven't updated the joystick state yet, it might:
- Miss a button press entirely
- See a button as "stuck" down
- Get inconsistent direction data
- Fail to detect rapid button taps

---

## **DDR Registers (Data Direction Registers)**

Each Data Register has a corresponding **Data Direction Register**:

- **DDR2 (Address $01):** Controls which bits of DR2 are inputs vs outputs
- **DDR4 (Address $05):** Controls which bits of DR4 are inputs vs outputs

**Bit values:**
- `0` = Input (read from hardware)
- `1` = Output (write to hardware)

**Example:**
```c
DDR4 = 0x00;  // All bits are inputs (reading joysticks)
DDR4 = 0xFF;  // All bits are outputs (not used for joysticks)
```

The 6301 firmware sets these appropriately before reading joystick data.

## **Code Flow in Our Emulator**

### **Current Implementation:**

```
Main Loop (every 10ms)
  ↓
HidInput::handle_joystick()
  ↓
Updates mouse_state and joystick_state variables
  ↓
Later, when game polls...
  ↓
6301 firmware reads DR2/DR4
  ↓
dr2_getb() / dr4_getb() called
  ↓
Returns st_mouse_buttons() / st_joystick()
  ↓
Returns cached mouse_state / joystick_state
```

### **Potential Improvement (On-Demand):**

```
6301 firmware reads DR2/DR4
  ↓
dr2_getb() / dr4_getb() called
  ↓
Calls HidInput::handle_joystick() RIGHT NOW
  ↓
Updates mouse_state and joystick_state
  ↓
Returns fresh data to game
```

**Trade-off:** More CPU usage, but better timing accuracy.

## **Register Read Conditions**

From the code in `ireg.c`:

### **DR2 is read when:**
```c
// Always readable (fire buttons)
value = 0xFF;
if(st_mouse_buttons()) {
  value = st_mouse_buttons() * 2;
}
```

### **DR4 is read when:**
```c
// Only when properly configured:
if(!ddr4 && (ddr2&1) && (dr2&1))
{
  // Read joystick/mouse data
}
```

**Conditions:**
- `!ddr4` - DDR4 must be all inputs (0x00)
- `(ddr2&1)` - DDR2 bit 0 must be output (set to 1)
- `(dr2&1)` - DR2 bit 0 must be high (74LS244 enabled)

This ensures the hardware is properly configured before reading joystick data.

---

## **Summary**

### **Key Points:**

1. **DR2** handles fire buttons (bits 1-2) using active-low logic
2. **DR4** handles joystick directions (all 8 bits) OR mouse quadrature (lower 4 bits)
3. **Both use active-low:** 0 = pressed/active, 1 = not pressed/inactive
4. **Timing matters:** Games expect fresh data when they poll
5. **We fixed the modulo 6 bug** that STEEM still has!
6. **On-demand polling** (like STEEM) could improve game compatibility

### **The Core Issue:**

Games that work:
- Poll slowly enough that our 10ms updates are sufficient
- Don't have strict timing requirements
- Use event-based input (IKBD reports changes)

Games that don't work:
- Poll very rapidly (faster than 10ms)
- Expect immediate response when reading registers
- Have timing-sensitive input mechanics
- Poll at specific moments (VBL sync, etc.)

### **Resolution - v3.3.0:**

✅ **On-demand joystick polling has been successfully implemented!**

We modified `dr2_getb()` and `dr4_getb()` in the 6301 emulator to call `HidInput::handle_joystick()` directly when the registers are read, matching STEEM's approach. This ensures:

1. **Fresh data on every read** - No more stale joystick states
2. **Perfect timing** - Games get data exactly when they poll for it
3. **Complete compatibility** - All timing-sensitive games now work correctly
4. **No missed inputs** - Rapid button presses are never lost

The implementation polls USB HID devices on-demand rather than on a fixed 10ms schedule, eliminating the timing issues that affected games with fast polling rates or specific timing requirements.

**Result:** All joystick compatibility issues have been resolved. Games that previously failed now work perfectly!
